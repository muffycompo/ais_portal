##Installation:

This package is based on composer, so if you have it installed you're pretty much halfway done already.

### Composer:
Download and install composer from `http://getcomposer.org/download/`

Add this to your project root's `composer.json` file:
```
{
    "require": {
        "noherczeg/breadcrumb": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
If you're done, just run a `php composer install`, and the package is ready to be used!

## Laravel specific settings

### Laravel 3 setup:
If you're using laravel 3 you will have to do the following to be able to use composer based packages:

- In your project dir's `paths.php` add the following line: `$paths['composer'] = 'vendor';`
- In your project dir's public/index.php: after the `require '../paths.php';` line add the following: `require path('composer').'autoload.php';`

### Registering package with Laravel 4 as a service:
Put the following in your `app/config/app.php` file under `providers` array:
```
'Noherczeg\Breadcrumb\BreadcrumbServiceProvider'
```

Adding the alias of the facade is done in the same file under `aliases`:
```
'Breadcrumb' => 'Noherczeg\Breadcrumb\Facades\Breadcrumb'
```

Overriding the default configurations is done in a published config file. You can create it by typing:
```
$ php artisan config:publish noherczeg/breadcrumb
```
